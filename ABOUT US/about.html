            <p>
                The everlasting vision of our company is to see a world void of constant
                struggles in regards to ocean pollution, a world united, teaming with both
                animals,nature and humans. We do this by asking ourselves how do we as humans
                elevate habitats back into their natural state. Our mission is to explore and expand
                technology in an efficient and safe way so that we may be able to help habitats with it.
                This is the main goal of our company to combat pollution, examples of this may include
                the recent venture into thermal and whirlpool technology that greatly speeds up environmental clean-up.
                Secondary methods of combating pollution for us would be beach clean-ups aswell as simple use of 
                net fishing that allows us to sweep and pull out harmful substances from within the ocean. Any monetary 
                value given to us through donations is 100% given back to nature, in the form of our many different services.
