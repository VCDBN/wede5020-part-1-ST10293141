                <p>The environment is not the only thing we're focused on though. What about the animals that 
                   suffer due to negligence of humans, our care program is designed specifically for each animal 
                   in terms of food, treatment and habitat protection. Keep checking our social platforms as sometimes 
                   we do meet and greets with the animal, this is perfect for kids.</p>
